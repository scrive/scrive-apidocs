-- | The table used to queue up async events.
--   Expected usage is basically write record, batch read records, batch
--   delete records in fairly rapid sequence. This, coupled with the
--   expectation that the table will never grow to any significant size
--   makes the omission of any keys seem the more performant choice - however,
--   we need a primary key to enable no downtime updates.
