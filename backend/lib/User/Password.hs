-- | Scrypt parameters used for hashing. Default scrypt parameters are
-- N = 14, r = 8, p = 1, we use slightly larger N and p. N=15 gives us
-- a 32M memory cost, p=2 then doubles the CPU cost. This means ~180
-- ms password hashing time on a 2016-level CPU, which I think is okay
-- for our purposes.
--
-- Alternatives I've considered:
--
-- * N = 16, r = 8, p = 1  -- time cost is ~the same, memory cost is 64M
--                            per pass, which I think is a bit too much.
-- * N = 15, r = 8, p = 1  -- time cost is halved to ~100 ms, which is actually
--                            the recommended time cost by the author of scrypt.
--                            I chose to be a little bit more
--                            conservative / future-proof.
