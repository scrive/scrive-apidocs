   There are two flash "types": flash message is old one, it contains
   flash type and its content (message or html code). Flash template,
   however, contains only informations about how we can obtain message/
   html code from it - it contains flash type, template name and list
   of fields that should be filled. It's kinda "lazy" flash message. To
   convert flash template to flash message, we need to call instantiate
   on it. Thus we need to call instantiate on all flashes before rendering
   a page.

   Why all that? Because with storing flashes in cookie we are limited to 4kB
   in size of such flash message/modal and that's not good. However, for bigger
   modals flash template form will be several times smaller than its flash message
   form.

   Rule of thumb is:
   - normally use FlashMessage form (just as in the past)
   - if flash/modal stops rendering, it most likely means it's too big and
     needs to be stored in template form. I'm aware of the fact that this
     is less powerful than using Templates directly (mainly beacuse we are
     limited to String type for fields), but oh well, I couldn't come up
     with anything better
