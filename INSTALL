Install Haskell Platform.

http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/

Everything below should be done in terminal.


If you are on Linux/Mac add:

export PATH=~/.cabal/bin:$PATH
 
to your ~/.bashrc file

This is a known issue that cabal install installs executables in ~/.cabal/bin by default, but this directory is not in $PATH, so later, when it tries to execute trhsx it cannot be found.


You need darcs to get our code. Do:

cabal install darcs


Our code resides on patch-tag.com. Get it like this:

darcs get <yourpatchtaglogin>@patch-tag.com:/r/gracjan/kontrakcja

this will not work, as I need you to add you as a project member. Create a patch-tag account, then contact me.

Now you should have a folder:

cd kontrakcja

this is the first name of SkrivaPa and it is going to stay as technical name.

Now it should be easy, do

cabal install -f-test

Now run:

kontrakcja-server

It should say that a kontrakcja.conf file is missing and should say what content needs to be there. Just create a file with copy and paste. Then run the server again. It should say:

Listening on port 8000...

Now browse to

http:://localhost:8000/

And you are up and running.... but you do not have an account there so you cannot do anything.

Please go to src/Kontra.hs and add your email to initialUsers. Your initial password will be 'admin'.

Have your fun at Swedish language with google translate :)
