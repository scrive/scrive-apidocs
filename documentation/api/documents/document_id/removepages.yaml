    Remove some pages from main PDF file of a document in `Preparation`.

    Checkboxes and signature areas that are placed on pages to be removed will
    be removed from their respective signatory.
    For standard and text fields, only the placements that are on the pages to
    be removed will be removed, the signatory field will still exist.
    As a consequence of removing pages, the `page` property of any placements
    may change to account for any removed pages.

    This operation will update the documentâ€™s `file` with a new one, that will
    have the requested pages removed from its current main file.
