  summary: Delete Access Role

  tags:
    - Access Control

  description: |
    The endpoint allows you to delete an explicitly granted access role.

    _Explicitly granted_ in this case generally means "role which was created
    via the Access Control API" as opposed to an implicit role acquired via, for
    example, User Group membership. If it has a non-`null` `id` field then it is
    an explicit role and can be deleted.

  parameters:
    - name: role_id
      in: url
      type: integer
      description: The ID of the Access Role you wish to view
      required: true

  responses:
    200:

        JSON object showing that an Access Role with the given ID has been
        successfully deleted.
    403:
      description: |
        Insufficient Permissions error (this means that you don't have Delete
        permissions upon the Policy relation of either the source or target of
        the role). Either that, or no Access Role exists with this `id`.
