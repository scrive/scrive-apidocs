    This endpoint allows you to delete a Folder.

    It's worth noting that you may only delete child Folders. Root Folders
    can only deleted by internal Scrive admins. We also do not support recursive
    deletion. If this is required, it can be implemented client-side by simply
    working up the tree, deleting the leaves.

  parameters:
    - name: folder_id
      in: url
      type: string
      description: The ID of the Folder you wish to delete
      required: true

  responses:
    200:

        JSON object showing that a Folder with the given ID has been
        successfully deleted.
    403:

        Insufficient Permissions error (this means that you don't have enough
        permissions to create this Folder. In practice this means that you lack
        Delete permissions on the Folder).
