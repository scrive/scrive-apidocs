    > Example of JSON that could be used create a new Folder:

    ```json
    {
      "name": "new child folder of 1",
      "parent_id": "1"
    }
    ```

    This endpoint allows you to create a new Folder. `parent_id` is mandatory
    (unless you are in internal Scrive admin user) since you are not permitted
    to create new root Folders. `name` will be an empty string if you do not
    include it.

  parameters:
    - name: folder
      in: formData
      type: string
      format: application/json
