    > Example of JSON that could be used update a Folder:

    ```json
    {
      "name": "new child folder of 1",
      "parent_id": "1"
    }
    ```

    This endpoint allows you to create a new Folder. Neither field is required,
    providing `{}` as your update JSON is essentially a "no op". The API does
    distinguish between `null` and "not present" so `"parent_id": null` will
    likely produce an error (unless you are an internal Scrive admin) since
    users are not permitted to promote child folders into new root folders.

  parameters:
    - name: folder_id
      in: formData
      type: string
      format: application/json
