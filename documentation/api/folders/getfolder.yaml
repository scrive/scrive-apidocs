    ```json
    {
      "id": "1",
      "parent_id": null,
      "name": "Root folder",
      "children": [
        {
          "id": "2",
          "name": "Subfolder of 1"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    This endpoint is used to get the details of a given folder. Note that the
    contents of the folder are not displayed, just the metadata about the
    folder.

    This metadata currently consists of the folder's ID, it's parent ID (if any)
    and the name/id of its immediate children (if any).

    @TODO: Need to clarify about the stuff Kuba did.

        Insufficient Permissions error (this means that you don't have enough
        permissions to create this Folder. In practise this means that you lack
        Read permissions on the Folder)
