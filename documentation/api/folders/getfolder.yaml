    ```json
    {
      "id": "1",
      "parent_id": null,
      "name": "Root folder",
      "children": [
        {
          "id": "2",
          "name": "Subfolder of 1"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    This endpoint is used to get the details of a given folder. Note that the
    contents of the folder are not displayed, just the metadata about the
    folder.

    This metadata currently consists of the folder's ID, it's parent ID (if any)
    and the name/id of its immediate children (if any).

  parameters:
    - name: folder_id
      in: url
      type: string
      description: The ID of the Folder you wish to view
      required: true

        Insufficient Permissions error (this means that you don't have enough
        permissions to view this Folder). In practice this means that you lack
        Read permissions on the Folder. Uniquely, for this endpoint, it is also
        possible to acquire Read permissions by being a signatory or approver
        of a document in that folder.
