  description: |
    Generate a temporary `login_token` which can be used with `getpersonaltoken`
    to get valid OAuth credentials for that user. The endpoint also returns a
    base64-encoded PNG image of a QR code. This QR code also contains the
    `login_token` embedded in a simple JSON structure. The only purpose of the
    JSON is to allow the potential for versioning in future.

  parameters:
    - name: minutes
      in: formData
      type: integer
      required: false
      default: 5
