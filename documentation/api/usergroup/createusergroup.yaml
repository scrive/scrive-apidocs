  summary: Create User Group

  tags:
    - User Group

  description: |
    This endpoint allows you to create a new User Group. When creating it, you
    have the option to set the User Group's name and to specify which other User
    Group it will be a child of.

    You must set a `parent_id` since only internal Scrive admins are permitted
    to create root User Groups. In order to create a new child, you must have
    the requisite permissions upon the parent.

    A full User Group JSON response is returned which displays the state _after_
    the create operation has been performed. Performing `/update` and then
    using the `GET` endpoint should produce the same output both times.

  parameters:
    - name: user_group_id
      in: url
      type: integer
      description: The ID of the User Group you wish to update
      required: true
    - name: usergroup
      in: formData
      type: string
      format: application/json

        JSON object containing the `name` and `parent_id` of the User Group to
        be created.
      example: { "name": "new user group", "parent_id": 1 }
      required: true
    - name: include_inheritable
      in: query
      type: boolean

        Append `?include_inheritable` to the URL to see a preview of which
        values can be inherited from an ancestor User Group.
      required: false

        Insufficient Permissions error (this means that either no User Group
        exists with this ID or that you do not have permission to update it)
