    This endpoint is used to delete a given User Group's `contact_details`
    object. This will cause the contact_details to be inherited rather than the
    User Group having its own dedicated contact_details object.

    As such, calling delete on a User Group that already inherits will result
    in no operation being performed. Also, attempting to delete the
    contact_details object of a root User Group will result in an error.

    For more details on inheritance, see [View User Group Contact Details](#view-user-group-contact-details).
