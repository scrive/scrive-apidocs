    This endpoint is used to delete a given User Group's `contact_details`
    object. This will cause the contact_details to be inherited rather than the
    User Group having its own dedicated contact_details object.

    As such, calling delete on a User Group that already inherits will be result
    in no operation being performed. Also, attempting to delete the
    contact_details object of a root User Group will result in an error for
    obvious reasons.

    Inheritance works as follows:

    Root User Groups (i.e. those who are not children of other User Groups) may
    not inherit since there are no ancestors to inherit from.

    A child User Group may inherit or have its own dedicated object. In the case
    that a User Group chooses to inherit the `contact_details` object, then that
    User Group will inherit from the closest direct ancestor with its own
    `contact_details` object. Since root User Groups cannot inherit, there will
    always be an ancestor from which a child can inherit.

    If you would like to see what a User Group _would_ inherit then you can
    append `?include_inheritable` to the URL when making the call. This will add
    extra `inheritable_preview` subtrees to the objects which perform the
    inheritance calculation, ignoring whether or not the User Group already
    inherits.
