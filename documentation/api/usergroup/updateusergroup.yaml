    > Example of JSON that could be passed in to update a User Group:

    > The JSON is URL-encoded and passed in via the `usergroup` form data field.
    > It is not necessary to minify the JSON, but also not prohibited.

    ```json
    {
      "parent_id": "1",
      "name": "UG that's now the child of user group 1"
    }
    ```

    > For examples of the JSON output, see details of "View User Group".

    This endpoint allows you to update the User Group's meta data, or to change
    its parent ID (i.e. to move this User Group so that it is the child of a
    differnt User Group).

    The JSON input must be passed, URL-encoded, via the `usergroup` form data
    field.

    When updating the `parent_id`, the following rules are in force:

    + Only internal Scrive admins can promote a child User Group to a root.
    + A root UserGroup may by subordinated to (i.e. made a child of) another User
    Group if you have permissions to modify the new parent and User Group
    being moved.
    + A child User Group may be moved to be a child of another User Group as long
    as you have permissions to update the group being moved, the new parent and
    the old parent.

    The endpoint supports partial updates. This means that only the fields you
    supply in your requests will have their values altered.

    A full User Group JSON response is returned which displays the state _after_
    the update operation has been performed. Performing `/update` and then
    using the `GET` endpoint should produce the same output both times.

    **Important Note**: *You cannot move usergroups by updating the `children`
    field, it must be done via `parent_id`*.
