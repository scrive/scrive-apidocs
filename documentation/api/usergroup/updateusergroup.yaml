  summary: Update User Group

  description: |
    This endpoint allows you to update the User Group's meta data, or to change
    its parent ID (i.e. to move this User Group so that it is the child of a
    differnt User Group).

    When updating the `parent_id`, the following rules are in force:

    Only internal Scrive admins can promote a child User Group to a root.

    A root UserGroup may by subordinated to (i.e. made a child of) another User
    Group if you have permissions to modify the new parent and User Group
    being moved.

    A child User Group may be moved to be a child of another User Group as long
    as you have permissions to update the group being moved, the new parent and
    the old parent.

    The endpoint supports partial updates. This means that only the fields you
    supply in your requests will have their values altered.

    A full User Group JSON response is returned which displays the state _after_
    the update operation has been performed. Performing `/update` and then
    using the `GET` endpoint should produce the same output both times.

  parameters:
    - name: user_group_id
      in: url
      type: integer
      description: The ID of the User Group you wish to update
      required: true
    - name: include_inheritable
      in: query
      type: boolean

        Append `?include_inheritable` to the URL to see a preview of which
        values can be inherited from an ancestor User Group.
      required: false

        exists with this ID or that you do not have permission to update it)
