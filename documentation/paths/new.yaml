  summary: New document

  tags:
    - Prepare

  description: |
    Create a new document with the given PDF (if any) as the main file.
    The new document will have state `Preparation`, and will not be a template.

    If no PDF is provided, you can set one using the `{document_id}/setfile`
    API call.

    *OAuth Privileges required: `DOC_CREATE`*

  parameters:
    - name: file
      in: formData
      type: file
      format: application/pdf
      required: false
      default: No file
      description: |
        **The PDF to use for the document.**

        If supplied, the documentâ€™s title will be set to the filename (with the
        extensions removed).
        Otherwise a default document title will be set, depending on the user
        language settings.
    - name: saved
      in: formData
      type: boolean
      required: false
      default: true
      description: |
        Whether the document should start out as being "saved" (*i.e.* appear
        in the E-archive).

        The document can be "saved" later, by setting the "saved" field to
        `true` via an `update` call.
        All API operations are applied immediately, the "saved" flag simply
        represents visibility in the E-archive.

      # FIXME It is possible to add a schema here, although APIError is too general
