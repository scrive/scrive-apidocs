title: Signatory Field
description: |
  The common elements of all `SignatoryField` types.

  This definition by itself is not sufficient, you need to use it in
  combination with one of the concrete types (e.g. `SignatoryFieldName`).
discriminator: type
required:
  - type
  - is_obligatory
type: object
properties:
  type:
    type: string
  is_obligatory:
    type: boolean
  placements:
    type: array
    description: |
      If set, where this should be placed on the document, both for the
      signatory to fill out on the signing page, and in the final sealed PDF.

      Note that this is an array, you can have multiple placements for the same
      field.

      The easiest way to set the `xrel`, `yrel`, etc. values is to create a
      template in the document UI design view, and use those values.
    items:
      type: object
      properties:
        xrel:
          type: number
        yrel:
          type: number
        wrel:
          type: number
        hrel:
          type: number
        fsrel:
          type: number
        page:
          description: The page number for this placement.
          type: integer
        tip:
          type: string
          enum:
            - left
            - right
        anchors:
          type: array
          items:
            type: object
            properties:
              text:
                type: string
              index:
                type: integer
