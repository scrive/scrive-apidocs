      Whether the signatory can edit a pre-filled value for this field.
      This is useful when you have signatory details on file, but you want them
      to be able to modify their email or mobile if it has changed.

      **Note:** Setting this to `true` means a signatory will _always_ be able
      to change the value on the signing page.
      If you want a signatory to authenticate with SMS PIN, please be aware
      that this may affect your desired workflow.
