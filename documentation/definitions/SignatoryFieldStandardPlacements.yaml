title: SignatoryFieldStandardPlacements
type: array
default: []
description: |
  If set, where this field should be placed on the document.
  This is both for the signatory to fill out on the signing page, and for
  the final sealed PDF.

  Note that this is an array, you can have multiple placements for the same
  field.

  The easiest way to set the `xrel`, `yrel`, etc. values is to create a
  template in the document UI design view, and use those values.
