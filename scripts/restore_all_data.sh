# Documenting an annoyance here:
#
# We could use pg-restore with -c (clean) mode, so it does DROP
# of every object that it tries to restore, but:
#   - DROP fails if this object does not exist
#   - DROP is only for objects that are going to be restored
#          and there is no CASCADE, so it does not clean attached
#          constraints for example
#
# Same story goes about other database features. We need to DROP
# LANGUAGE plpgsql so it can be recreated just a moment later.
#
# So we need to plainly drop the database before restoring.
# Warning: this is not transactional so be careful!
