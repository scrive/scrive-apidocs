-- | Given an action f and a number of seconds t, cron will execute f
-- every t seconds.  A flag determines if the first execution starts
-- immediately, or after t seconds.
--
-- Returned value should be used for ordering given action to stop executing
-- by passing it to stopCron. After that you can call wait on passed ThreadGroup
-- to wait until running action (if there is one) finishes safely.
--
-- Note that action may use supplied function to enter interruptible state, ie.
-- call to stopCron issued when action is running, but within interruptible section
-- will interrupt the action immediately (this is particurarly useful when action
-- has to block for a period of time and it's safe to interrupt it in such state).
