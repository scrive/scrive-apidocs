Purpose</h2><p>The purpose of this document is to set a framework for the understanding of digital evidence quality. Additionally it explains how the Scrive e-signed documents relate to such framework.</p><h2><a id="h.6j1q5iz7f4dp"></a>2. What is quality digital evidence?</h2><p>Evidence collection is a security measure that the parties signing an agreement or another type of document, use to protect themselves in the event of a future dispute. The evidence can serve the purpose of clarifying the circumstances of the signing event; what was signed, how it was signed and who the signatories were. The value of quality evidence cannot be overstated, as it can be the difference between winning and losing in the event of a dispute.</p><p>We have studied several evidence container technologies such as the signed paper document, the printed facsimile and the recorded voice to understand how to generate quality evidence in a digital environment. We found that there has been good reason to perceive the signed paper document as the gold standard for evidence quality; it has several inherent qualities that are not easily transferable into digital formats. In fact we found that new technologies have been introduced at the cost of significant loss in quality of evidence; crucial information is left out of such digital evidence containers and as a result the usefulness of such evidence is highly dependent on third parties. This section explores the key characteristics of the signed paper document as compared to digital evidence container formats with the purpose of exploring what is required to reproduce, or improve, the evidence characteristics of the signed paper document.</p><h3><a id="h.60efzxcb0csl"></a>2.1 Integrity</h3><p>To prove that evidence is legitimate it is important to be able to show that it has not been tampered with.</p><p>As outlined in the table below, integrity is an inherent quality of the signed paper document but not necessarily that of a digital evidence container. The integrity of a digital evidence container is highly dependent on the design of the system that produces it.</p><p>Question to ask:</p><p>How to emulate the integrity properties of the signed paper document in a digital evidence container?</p><a href="#" id="5c8f556fab6b4f93e3e7d3be08eed58497e6aba1"></a><a href="#" id="0"></a><table><tbody><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Signed paper document</p></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Digital evidence container</p></th></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Integrity</p><p>Can the evidence container be altered after its creation?</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>A signed paper document is rarely questioned as evidence, unless there is good reason to believe otherwise. The reason being, that paper is by nature an immutable format; once signed it is difficult to manipulate the available evidence (typically paper mass, ink and fingerprints) without leaving traces of such manipulation. Thus a signed paper document is a durable “snapshot” of reality at the time that the document was signed.</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Digital evidence such as a PDF or an audio file, is by nature mutable. It is easy to alter digital evidence without leaving traces of manipulation.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><a id="h.yy6bj5em3h5x"></a>2.2 Accessibility</h3><p>To be able to make use of evidence it is key that it is as accessible as possible, meaning that all aspects of the evidence can be understood with a minimum amount of specialised expertise and tools.</p><p>As outlined in the table below, accessibility is an inherent quality of the signed paper document but not necessarily that of a digital evidence container.

The other elements traditionally required for a legally binding contract are (i) consideration and (ii) an intention to create legal relations. Thus, intent is a key component in making a contract legally binding.</p><p>As outlined in the table below, evidence of intent is an inherent quality of the signed paper document but not necessarily that of a digital evidence container. The quality of the evidence of intent in a digital evidence container is highly dependent on the design of the software that produces it.</p><p>Question to ask:</p><p>How to produce evidence of the intent to sign in a digital signing environment and how to match that intent with a specific document?</p><a href="#" id="58f0b1eef3ad55a89fbef0a4f5fa386a2fda7dac"></a><a href="#" id="2"></a><table><tbody><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Signed paper document</p></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Digital evidence container</p></th></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Output</p><p>Is the final output the same as what is viewed at the time of signing?</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>The signing environment (the paper document) is the same as the final output (the signed paper document).</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>The digital signing environment is not the same as the final output. i.e. the displayed information is not the same as the digital evidence produced by the system after signing.</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Comprehensibility</p><p>Is the signing environment easily comprehensible to the signatory? </p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>To sign a paper document is a standardised ritual to form a binding agreement.

Therefore it is not possible to assume that the signing environment made it immediately clear to the signatory that it was participating in the formation of a legally binding contract, thus intent can never be assumed.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Let us illustrate the potential consequences of weak evidence of intent in a digital signing environment with an example:</p><p>Two parties go to court over a contract signed in a digital signing environment. One of the parties claims that it didn’t sign a contract. Instead it claims that it was displayed with a) an interesting drawing of a blue elephant, b) a question if it would like to see an equally interesting pink sheep, and c) a button to proceed to view the pink sheep. Then the party selected to proceed by clicking the button to see the pink sheep, viewed the pink sheep and went to bed. There was no intent to sign a contract; there was only intent to view a pink sheep.</p><h3><a id="h.4fpfbt679rz5"></a>2.4 Evidence of identity</h3><p>To be able to prove the identity of a signatory, the strength and accessibility of such evidence is key.</p><p>As outlined in the table below, evidence of identity is an inherent quality of the signed paper document but not necessarily that of a digital evidence container. The quality of the evidence of identity in a digital evidence container is highly dependent on the design of the software that produces it.

The Evidence Features may be captured in the same evidence container or distributed across multiple evidence containers, within or outside of the signatory’s direct control, such as but not limited to documents, databases or human memory. Optimally, as much as possible of the Evidence Features should be concentrated into evidence containers under the signatory’s direct control because a) the third party can cease to exist and as a result the evidence may be destroyed, b) the third party’s systems and/or administration may change and affect the accessibility of the evidence for the signatory, c) the third party’s incentives as an agent to protect the integrity of the evidence may not be, or stop being, aligned with the signatory’s incentives as a principal and thus increasing the risk of evidence loss or the risk of tampering that may affect the evidence quality or d) any combination of the aforementioned scenarios.</p><p>As outlined in the table below, control is an inherent quality of the signed paper document but not necessarily that of a digital evidence container.

Scrive’s solution</h2><h3><a id="h.2l0m2mlax270"></a>3.1 Introduction</h3><p>We have now analysed the evidence quality characteristics of the signed paper document versus digital evidence containers. This section describes the Evidence Package and how it has been designed in relation to the evidence quality characteristics. Our goal has been to reproduce the evidence qualities of the signed paper document, the long-standing gold standard for evidence containers, while at the same time add new qualities enabled by new technology. The end result is an evidence container not only imitating the most important features of the signed paper document but also with qualities superior to the signed paper document.</p><p>As explained in the introduction section to this Evidence Documentation, Scrive eSign is designed to a) enable its users to define workflows for signing electronically, b) execute the e-signing workflow, c) record the evidence and d) once all signatories have signed, use the recorded evidence to produce the Evidence Package. Thus, the Evidence Package is the end result of all these four steps in Scrive eSign and to be able to understand the Evidence Package, it is important to understand each of these four steps. This section explains the four steps in Scrive eSign required for producing the Evidence Package.</p><h3><a id="h.x942erlant2r"></a>3.2 Summary</h3><p>The Evidence Package addresses the questions in the section “How to create quality evidence?” in the following ways:</p><a href="#" id="56d44f96cae0ed9828c420e26867ee2b3088b876"></a><a href="#" id="7"></a><table><tbody><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Topic</p></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Question</p></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Evidence Package</p></th></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Integrity</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>How to emulate the immutability of the signed paper document in a digital evidence container?</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Scrive eSign seals the Evidence Package with a digital signature (see step 10 in the Service Description).

The screenshot included in the Evidence of Intent which include a picture of the signed document in the background is intended to strengthen the evidence that what was viewed in Scrive eSign was the same as the output.
