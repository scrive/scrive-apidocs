This document provides a brief introduction to Scrive eSign so that a holder of a Scrive e-signed document can easily explain such document in court. For in-depth documentation, start by reading the attachment Evidence Package Introduction.</p><h2><a id="h.bfgifv80y2b4"></a>Scrive eSign system</h2><p>Scrive eSign is developed by Scrive AB and is designed to:</p><ol start="1"><li>Enable its users to define workflows for signing electronically</li><li>Execute the signing workflow</li><li>Record as many of the signatories’ actions as possible as log data</li><li>Once all signatories have signed, produce a final digital evidence package of the electronically signed materials together with the log data and other supporting materials necessary to optimise the usefulness of the evidence (the “Evidence Package”)</li></ol><h2><a id="h.tpbx43gcvyuv"></a>E-signing workflow</h2><p>This is how a document is signed through Scrive eSign:</p><ol start="1"><li>To start the signing process the user of Scrive eSign either a) defines the signing process in the administrative user interface and selects to start the process, b) starts from a template process in the administrative user interface or c) starts from a template process within a system that has integrated with Scrive.</li><li>To access the signing workflow the counterpart(s) either a) receive an email or SMS with an invitation to sign electronically and a link to the e-signing user interface, b) receive a tablet with the e-signing user interface already opened or c) are redirected from a webpage or client application user interface to the e-signing user interface.</li><li>To review the document the counterpart(s) view the e-signing user interface and a) read instructions at the top that they shall follow the green instruction arrows to complete the signing process, b) depending on the signing process settings enter or not enter extra information into the document such as text and signatures, checks in checkboxes and extra document appendices and c) scroll through all document pages to reach the button with the text “sign” placed below the last page of the document (the “Signing Button”).</li><li>To sign the document the counterpart(s) presses the Signing Button and, depending on the signing process settings, either a) a popup appears where they are informed that by clicking the Signing Button at the bottom of the popup, they are signing the document and that Scrive eSign will register their signature or b) a popup appears where they are asked to select their type of e-legitimation and sign the document using their installed eID application. </li><li>The confirmation text that the document has been signed upon clicking the Signing Button, is automatically displayed to the counterpart(s) in a web user interface and b) sent to the counterpart(s) in an email including the Evidence Package.</li></ol><h2><a id="h.s8gmfzn0dx53"></a>Evidence Package</h2><p>To understand how to generate quality evidence in a digital environment Scrive has studied several evidence container technologies such as the signed paper, the printed facsimile and the recorded voice. We found that there has been good reason to perceive the signed paper document as the gold standard for evidence quality; it has several inherent qualities that are not easily transferrable into digital formats.</p><p>As a result of our research Scrive eSign has been designed to produce an Evidence Package that reproduce the evidence qualities of the paper, while at the same time add new qualities enabled by new technology. A key feature of the Evidence Package is that it shall be self-documenting, meaning that the signed document in itself shall contain all evidence necessary to explain the transaction.</p></body></html>
