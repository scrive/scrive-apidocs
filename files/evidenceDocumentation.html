<p><i>Note: This is a summary table. Full explanation is given in the text below.</i></p>

<h1 id="p1">Loss of document quality</h1>

<p>Signing can be done in many ways. The standard has traditionally been signing a paper document. With the digital age the paper document standard has evolved into alternative formats such as the printed fax and the scanned PDF.</p>

<p>At the time of writing (the year of 2013), new document formats have been introduced to facilitate transactions and reduce transaction costs. The price for the reductions in transaction costs has been a dramatic decrease in the evidence qualities of signed documents.</p>

<p>In recent years there has evolved a plethora of software solutions for signing agreements electronically. Whilst these solutions have further lowered transaction costs, few have addressed the issues with decreasing document evidence qualities and none have set forward a solution that could fully bring back document evidence quality to the level of the printed-paper.</p>

<h1 id="p2">Scrive is better than paper</h1>

<p>We care about quality and we think that only the best is good enough. Therefore we have dug deep into understanding the document quality problems and made sure to create an appropriate document structure and evidence generation strategies to create what, to our knowledge, is the best quality evidence container in the world. Yes, we would even like to claim that it&#8217;s better than paper, the gold standard for evidence containers. Further down you will find out more about our solution, but first let us start with further fleshing out the problems with the current evidence quality situation and how current solutions fail to solve the issues.</p>

<h1 id="p3">Qualities lost</h1>

<p>Paper has several qualities that are so obvious to us that we take them for granted. At the same time the qualities are easily lost with new document formats. Let’s take a brief look at these innate qualities of paper format.</p>

<h2><em>Durability</em></h2>

<p>To prove an agreement it’s important that available evidence is credible. An original copy of the signed agreement is usually considered to be a good piece of such credible evidence. One reason is that paper is by nature an immutable format, once signed it is not editable and it is virtually impossible to remove all data available (fingerprints and ink). Thus it is a durable “snapshot” of reality at the time of making the agreement. Digital formats such as the PDF copy of a signed and scanned paper document are by nature mutable formats. You can easily edit the document content in an editor program such as Adobe Photoshop and it’s not very difficult to remove old and make new time markers to fit a new made up story about the document. Thus, it’s important to ask: how to emulate the immutability of the paper format?</p>

<h2><em>Accessibility</em></h2>

<p>Accessibility is a key component for a document to be useful. The less specialised expertise or tools required for the interpretation of the document the more likely it is to be useful evidence as more people can access it easily. Paper has two characteristics that make it highly accessible:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Paper is a format where all the contents are clearly displayed to everyone with eyes to read and thus paper doesn’t require any additional tools to interpret the contents.</p></li>
<li><p>Paper is a standard format known to everyone and as such it is easy to find out what to look for to identify the authenticity of the document, as that knowledge is commonly available.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Digital documents have the opposite characteristics:</p>

<p>a. Digital documents can come in any form and knowledge about their interpretation is highly dependent on the document format. Also information can be placed anywhere inside the document (not necessarily only in places that are available to the naked eye and thus it is not automatically obvious where to look for the information.</p>

<p>b. Digital documents by nature require additional tools to interpret. For example PDF-readers or other types of software. In best case the format is standardised and the tools are easy to come by.</p>

<p>As you understand accessibility is in the nature of the paper document but not automatically in the nature of a digital document. Thus, availability of a digital document is highly dependant on the design of the software that produces it. What is required to make a digital document as available as a paper document or at least as available as possible?</p>

<h2><em>Capturing identity</em></h2>

<p>Paper automatically collects evidence of identity of the signing parties. A signature is appended and the visual representation is useful for signature comparisons and the ink can be analysed to date the agreement. Also, in the process of signing, the paper automatically captures fingerprints and other biometric materials from the signing parties and can at a later point in time be used to authenticate the signature. In the case of digital signed documents there is no automatic collection of identity into the document. Data about identity is only captured from the signing parties and stored inside the document if the signing software is programmed to do so. Thus, capturing of identity is highly dependant on the design of the software that produces the final document. What identity data should be captured and how should it be placed inside the document?</p>

<h2><em>Capturing intent</em></h2>

<p>Contract law world wide states that an agreement come into effect when the agreeing parties understand that they are signing and have a voluntary intent to do so. Thus, intent is a key ingredient for the formation of an agreement. Paper has the characteristics that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The signing environment (the paper) is the same as the final output (the signed paper).</p></li>
<li><p>Signing a paper is the most standardised form of making an agreement and any mentally capable adult will understand exactly what is happening when signing on paper.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, upon signing on paper you are assumed to have understood the implications of your actions and it is virtually impossible to claim that you had no intention to sign. The only way you can get away is if you can credibly prove your mental inability at the time of signing or that your were for some reason forced to sign and that it thus wasn&#8217;t a voluntary action.</p>

<p>On the other hand a digital environment has the opposite characteristics to paper:</p>

<p>a. The signing environment is not the same as the final output.</p>

<p>b. Signing in a digital environment can happen in an infinite amount of ways.</p>

<p>Both these characteristics make it easy to claim that it was not your intention to sign. You can claim that the signing environment did not portray the same information as the final output (the displayed agreement was not the same as the document produced by the system) or you can claim that the signing environment did not make it clear that you were signing. Let’s make an extreme example:</p>

<p><em>Instead of showing “do this to sign this agreement as displayed here” it showed “here is a blue elephant, click here to see a pink sheep instead.” Thus, upon clicking the button the party could not have been aware that they were signing an agreement and thus would have no intention to sign.</em></p>

<p>This is of course an extreme example but it does point out a central problem with digital signing environments: how do you prove the intention to sign in a digital environment?</p>

<h1 id="p4">Potential for new additional qualities</h1>

<p>Paper has many important qualities as a high quality evidence container. Though there are several important improvement opportunities with new technology.</p>

<h2><em>Metadata collection</em></h2>

<p>Whilst the paper only allows for a restricted set of metadata to be appended to the document and the data must be appended manually by writing (time, place and other comments), digitally signed documents allow for an infinite amount of metadata to be appended in an infinite amount of formats (video, audio, text and more) thus opening up new possibilities for appending much larger quantities and variety of data strengthening the document qualities as legal evidence.</p>

<h2><em>Capturing time</em></h2>

<p>In many processes, such as bidding processes, exact time measurement is important to the transaction, as it can be the difference between an approved or a disapproved bid. When it comes to signed paper it is fairly blunt as a time recorder whilst digital documents can record time with a much higher accuracy. Though, as a famous Swedish court case shows, recording time is not necessarily the same as a credible time record. Example:</p>

<p><em>In an interesting type case a company was in a bidding process and sent their bid by fax one minute to twelve, just in the last minute before deadline. The time recorded by the receiving fax machine was one minute past twelve, just past the time for the deadline. As this was a bid to a Swedish municipality, Swedish law prohibited acceptance of the bid. The bidding party, convinced that their fax time was correctly set, went to court disputing the case. The case went all the way to the supreme court where the supreme court ruled in favour of the receiving party as it could not be proven that the receiving party actually had the wrong time set on their fax machine. The problem was also that the telecom company Telia that was responsible for the fax wire had not set their system in such a way that they could prove the time deviation of their system from standard time. Thus, it could not be credibly shown that the time record of Telia was accurate.</em></p>

<h1 id="p5">Quality comparison between standard formats</h1>

<p>To give an overview of the quality status of available formats the following table describes the difference in essential legal qualities between paper and other newer document formats. Find a short explanation of each formats status below the table. Note that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Paper has already been described in the previous section as the standard and will therefore not be described in further detail below.</p></li>
<li><p>Notes about capturing time would be the same for all different cases. The answer to all is that: it depends on each service provider and as described above it&#8217;s known that even the biggest can fail. We will therefore not describe this in any further detail below.</p></li>

<h2><em>Fax</em></h2>

<p>The “fax” is a result of a document signed on paper and sent back to the counterpart by using a facsimile.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Strengths</em>: The facsimile is paper. Therefore just like paper it captures intent and is highly durable and accessible just like a normal signed paper.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Weaknesses</em>: What the fax really lacks is biometric data from both signing parties (fingerprints and more). The fax only transmits a photocopy of the signature as an identifier and could therefore be considered to be substantially weaker than paper when it comes to capturing identity. Another weakness is metadata collection. Some metadata might be printed on the document when the fax is printed but the format doesn&#8217;t allow for very much more than the standard paper (time, place and some comments) therefore the data collection can be considered to be as weak as the data collection for paper.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2><em>Scanned PDF</em></h2>

<p>The “scanned PDF” is a result of printing the contract on paper, signing with a pen and then scanning and sending the document back using email or other electronic communication. More and more commonly the printing and signing step is also eliminated and the signing is executed by a copy and paste procedure (reusing a saved signature), by using some kind of software.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Strengths</em>: The scanned PDF is originally signed on paper or by a similar digital method controlled by the signing party. Therefore intent to sign can be considered to be executed in the same way as on a paper. There is some automatic collection of metadata in the digital transaction (usually email), especially if the email contains the full thread of the previous interaction and therefore metadata collection can be considered to be fairly good. The signed and scanned PDF is a standard format so the accessibility can be considered to be high both because it is easy to interpret the contents and the availability of the technology required to do so.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Weaknesses</em>: The main problem with the scanned PDF is that usually no measures have been taken to ensure the documents durability and thus provability of integrity over time (such as applying a digital signature for example). Therefore the document is susceptible to forgery and is very weak as evidence of the transaction. Actually the e-mail with which the document was sent could be argued to be stronger evidence of the transaction than the document itself, as log records will actually exist of the email transaction as supportive evidence. Unfortunately as the scanned PDF-document is highly mutable, the credibility of the visual signature also suffers as it is easy to copy-paste a new signature into the document at some later point in time and erase any traces of such editing. Therefore capturing the identity of the signed and scanned PDF is weaker than in the fax case and could be considered to be close to zero if no measure to ensure document durability has been applied (ex. a digital signature).</p></li>
</ul>

<h2><em>Email OK</em></h2>

<p>The “email OK” is a result of one party emailing a document or a text string with the agreement and the other party answering with an “OK” or similar.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Strengths</em>: The email OK is “signed” (OK:ed) with a software that can be considered to have been within each signing parties domain of control. Therefore the intent to sign can be assumed. Also the format of the “document” (email) is a standard format, the contents should be easy to interpret and the tools (email client) should be easy to obtain. Therefore accessibility can be considered high.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Weaknesses</em>: Just like with the scanned PDF usually no measures are taken to ensure the document durability and provability of integrity over time (such as applying a digital signature). Therefore the email is, just like the scanned PDF, susceptible to forgery and evidence of integrity is dependent on the availability and quality of the logs of the email provider. Identity usually cannot be captured in any other way than capturing the email of the counterpart. In many B2B transactions where the counterpart has a company specific email this is good enough as identification. In B2C or C2C transactions identification can easily be an issue as private persons have email addresses from providers that don&#8217;t require any identification (such as Gmail, Yahoo or Hotmail) and therefore in such cases possibilities for identification can be considered very weak.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2><em>E-signing PDF</em></h2>

<p>The “e-signing PDF” is a result of the parties using a third party SaaS provider as a platform for executing the agreement. Usually one party uses the software to invite the counterpart to sign inside the SaaS provider’s software and the final product of the procedure is an e-signed PDF produced and stamped by the SaaS provider. This type of software is used as a signing process management tool. Scrive is one of many solutions within this category of solutions. In this section we describe our overall perspective of known solutions, Scrive excluded (to be described in more detail further down):</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Strengths</em>: These types of services enable identification in many different ways such as email, IP-address, text messaging, photo, fingerprint scanning and more. All this identity data can be captured and placed into the document. Most e-signing services provide multiple types of identification and could therefore be considered to be fairly strong in this area. Although of course, the quality of the identification is dependant on what the sending user selects as the method for identification. Most services also collect metadata about the transaction and print it into the document as a time trail describing the actions taken by the parties with IP and time. Thus, metadata collection can be considered to be fairly strong.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Weaknesses</em>: One of the main differences between the method of generating an e-signed PDF and the other types of processes generating signed documents (described above) is that the receiving counterpart cannot be considered to have control over the signing environment. This is a major problem because suddenly it is not at all as easy to prove the intent to sign of the party receiving the invitation. As described in an example earlier they could claim that they didn’t understand that they were signing and that “the only experience they had was the display of a blue elephant and a clickable button to see a pink sheep as the next image.” To our knowledge no e-signing service today claims to solve this issue. We would guess that from the lack of documentation most might not even be aware of the problem and the business risk they are exposing their clients to by this ignorance. We see two more problems. First, it is rare that the e-signing providers take measures to ensure the document durability (ex. stamp the document with a digital signature). This means that the evidence of the document integrity lies in the logs at the e-signing service’s database. Thus, the business customers of the e-signing providers are in effect giving up the ability to prove the originality of core company documents and are effectively giving themselves to be at the mercy of e-signing providers good will and/or further existence. We don&#8217;t believe that this is a healthy situation for any company to be in. Every company should have complete and indisputable ownership of their own legal documents. Second, as the documents produced by the e-signing provider cannot by default be considered to be standard (as the format is still new to the market and the standard is still in creation), one needs to read documentation or inspect the document by oneself to figure out all aspects of the document. Thus, the accessibility is partially limited. Most probably both legal and technical expertise is required to find out about all aspects of the document. This is of course problematic as it can potentially skew the power to parties with deeper pockets or more expertise available and can also induce insecurities in a legal process. What if the court cannot fully interpret the document? What if the e-signing provider is no longer in existence to assist with an explanation?</p></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="p6">Problems due to lack of independence</h1>

<p>Things change and companies come and go. Signed documents stay the same. If the provability of a signed document is dependent on third parties the document provability risks changing over time. Except from the signed paper format no other solution is completely independent of third parties for evidence. Fax, scanned PDF, email OK and e-signed PDF are all dependent on third parties for their logs and time drift records. We believe that future provability should never be compromised due to dependencies on external parties.</p>

<h1 id="p7">Scrive’s solution</h1>

<p>At Scrive we are very proud of our solution: an evidence container with higher quality than paper and whose provability is independent of third parties. This is how we do it.</p>

<h2><em>Time Drift Prevention system</em></h2>

<p>As described earlier capturing time in a credible manner can be very important. Even though the cases when it is as crucial might not be that many we believe that it is not always possible for businesses to determine this on beforehand. Therefore, to eliminate this unnecessary company risk, a quality solution should solve this for 100% of all documents signed.</p>

<p>At Scrive we keep our systems synchronized with local NTP (Network Time Protocol) systems that are synced to as high a stratum NTP server as possible. This produces an accuracy of time that is virtually impossible to refute. The minimum and maximum poll intervals for the NTP server are left at defaults (minpoll 6, maxpoll 10 on the default Linux NTP server – these settings are seconds to the power of 2). This is because updating too often can be prone to more errors and jitter, and updating after too long can produce bigger corrections due to the larger timespan between updates. With these settings we have had an average drift of 0.000789 seconds and a maximum drift of 0.022 seconds the year 2012.</p>

<p>For provability purposes the latest synchronizations and reported time drift at each synchronization is recorded by the Scrive system and inserted into the Evidence Log (as described below).</p>

<h2><em>Generating the Evidence Package</em></h2>

<p>Scrive provides a set of signing processes that enable the signing parties to come to an agreement. Once all signing parties have signed the agreement the Scrive system will execute the following actions to finalize the especially designed “Evidence Package”:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make the agreement into a PDF.</li>
<li>Print additional information added during the signing process into the PDF (visual signature, text, checked checkboxes and more).</li>
<li>Append a “Verification Page” as an extra page to the PDF. </li>
<li>Append an “Evidence Documentation” as an appendix to the PDF. It is the Evidence Documentation that you are currently reading.</li>
<li>Append an “Evidence Log” as an appendix to the PDF.</li>
<li>Append an “Evidence of Intent” as an appendix to the PDF.</li>
<li>Append a “Digital Signature Documentation” as an appendix to the PDF.</li>
<li>Sign the Evidence Package (PDF plus appendices) with a digital signature.</li>
</ol>

<p>A detailed description of the steps 3-8 follows below.</p>

<h2><em>Step 3: Appending the Verification Page</em></h2>

<p>The Verification Page is intended to make the most important metadata of the transaction as accessible as possible. The key details are who signed which documents, when and how. The Verification Page contains the following information:</p>

<ul>
<li>Transaction ID</li>
<li>Selected document details</li>
<li>Selected signing person details</li>
<li>Selected non-signing person details</li>
<li>Selected actions of each signing person, time of action and IP-number </li>
<li>A seal confirming that a third party has verified the transaction</li>
</ul>

<p>At the end of the Verification Page there is brief documentation describing what the verification page is. The documentation is intended to give the reader all the information necessary in order to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Understand the nature of the document</li>
<li>Understand where to find any additional documentation about the document</li>
<li>Understand how to simply verify the integrity of the document</li>
</ul>

<p>This information is intended to be useful even if Scrive ceases to exist, making the document understandable and useful independently of Scrive.</p>

<h2><em>Step 4: Appending the Evidence Documentation</em></h2>

<p>A full documentation about the Evidence Package is appended as an appendix to the signed PDF (hereinafter the “Evidence Documentation”). The Evidence Documentation is a complete instruction manual of how to interpret the different parts of the Evidence Package and is intended to make understanding and use of the Evidence Package as easy as possible and independently of any third party (including independence from Scrive), thus removing the need for any special resources or expertise for the interpretation of the document and making it fully accessible and useful for anyone.</p>

<h2><em>Step 5: Appending the Evidence Log</em></h2>

<p>The Scrive system will record as much as possible of the signatories’ actions as log data (“Transaction Log”) and once the Scrive system has produced the signed PDF, a document containing all data from the Transaction Log is appended as an appendix (“Evidence Log”). Note that the Verification Page only contains selected transaction log data with the intention to make a preselected set of transaction history easily accessible, while the Evidence Log contains all transaction log data with the intention to make all transaction history easily accessible. The extensive logging of the parties actions and the appending of the Evidence Log is carried out with the intention of optimally enhancing the document quality through the additional metadata of the transaction.</p>

<h2><em>Step 6: Appending the Evidence of Intent</em></h2>

<p>The Scrive system will make screen shots of each party&#8217;s signing experience. Then, when the Scrive system is preparing the Evidence Package it will append the Evidence of Intent that is a document with the relevant signing experience screen shots and a brief description of the signing process and who did what. The intention with appending the Evidence of Intent is to provide the parties with evidence of intent to sign in order to efficiently avoid the potential court situation described above and exemplified with the blue elephant and the pink sheep.</p>

<h2><em>Step 7: Appending the Digital Signature Documentation</em></h2>

<p>The Scrive system will also append the Digital Signature Documentation to the Evidence Package. The Digital Signature Documentation contains an algorithm for how to prove the document&#8217;s integrity mathematically. With the help of the Digital Signature Documentation the document integrity can be tested mathematically without the help of Scrive or any other third party. This document does require some technical knowledge to be useful.</p>

<p>Note that the Digital Signature Documentation is not intended as the main route for proving the document integrity. The Digital Signature Documentation is only intended as a last resort when all other methods of verifying the integrity have failed. The intended order for verifying the integrity is:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Scrive provides the main route at www.scrive.com/verify. Here the document owner can upload the document and get an automated validation of the document integrity. This main route does not require any technical knowledge to be useful.</p></li>
<li><p>If the main route for some reason fails to perform the verification of integrity then the digital signature provider (Guardtime) can be contacted directly for verification. This second route also does not require any technical knowledge to be useful.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, if both previous methods to perform the verification of integrity have failed, the digital signature documentation can be used to prove the document’s integrity.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2><em>Step 8: Appending the Digital Signature</em></h2>

<p>Once all extra documentation has been appended to the document, the document wrapper is digitally signed with an industry standard digital signature from Guardtime.</p>

<h2><em>Summary 1: Legal effects of the Scrive solution</em></h2>

<p>To summarize, all the above measures involved in producing the Scrive PDF effectively address the different problems of deteriorating digital document quality.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Infinite durability (better than paper) is assured with the help of appending the digital signature (step 8) and with the help of the Digital Signature Documentation (step 7).</p></li>
<li><p>Maximal accessibility is assured by appending the Verification Page to the PDF with the short documentation inside (step 3) and appending the full Evidence Documentation document which fully explains all parts of the document and eliminates any further need for expertise and resources (step 4).</p></li>
<li><p>Capturing identity is assured by meticulous data collection to the Transaction Logs and the printing selected ID data into both the Verification Page (step 3) and more fleshed out ID data into the Evidence Log (step 5).</p></li>
<li><p>Capturing intent is assured by the screen shot mechanism and by appending the Evidence of Intent document to the PDF (step 6).</p></li>
<li><p>Capturing time is assured by the Time Drift Prevention system, the logging of average, max and minimum time drift and the recording of such into the Evidence Log (step 5).</p></li>
<li><p>Collecting additional data to improve the document quality further is carried out by the Time Drift Prevention system and by the redundant collection of logs into the Transaction Log and the final printing of all available data into the Evidence Log (step 5).</p></li>
</ul>

<h2><em>Summary 2: Independence effects of the Scrive solution</em></h2>

<p>The holder of the document is made independent of Scrive because:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The holder of the document is not dependent on the Scrive logs to prove document durability due to the digital signature appended (step 8) and the Digital Signature Documentation (step 7).</p></li>
<li><p>The holder of the document is not dependent on the Scrive logs for additional evidence in case of conflict as all evidence available to Scrive was made available to the holder of the document through the Evidence Log (step 5).</p></li>
<li><p>The holder of the document is not dependent on access to old versions of the Scrive system to prove the original signing environment to prove all parties&#8217; intent to sign, instead the evidence of intent is made available to the holder of the document through the Evidence of Intent document (step 6).</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, the holder of the document is made independent of other parties or Scrive’s expertise to interpret the document through the Evidence Documentation document that is appended (step 4).</p></li>
</ol>

<h1 id="p8">Final word</h1>

<p>It took us about three years to fully understand the complexities of creating the ultimate digital evidence container and to make such a container into reality. We don’t charge anything extra for making the above, instead we see it as an integral part of our solution and what we stand for. We hope that you appreciate our solution and our obsession with delivering the highest quality solutions.</p>
