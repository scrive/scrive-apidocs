<h1>Evidence Documentation</h1>
<div class="content">
<p id="top">This documentation (the “Evidence Documentation”) is one of many attachments inside a Scrive PDF (“the Evidence Package”). The Evidence Documentation is a complete instruction manual of how to interpret the different parts of the Evidence Package and is intended to provide an understanding and make use of the Evidence Package as easily as possible and independently of any third party (including independence from Scrive), thus removing the need for any special resources or expertise for the interpretation of the document and making it fully accessible and useful for anyone.</p>


<h2>The importance of evidence quality</h2>

	<p>In the case of agreements and other types of document signing, evidence collection is a security measure that we use to protect ourselves in the case of conflicts in the future. The evidence collected can serve the purpose of clarifying what was actually agreed or not agreed, the circumstances of when the agreement took place and disclosing the identity of all parties involved. The value of quality evidence cannot be overstated, as it is likely to be the difference between winning and losing a case. </p>

<h2>New technology and evidence quality</h2>

	<p>Signing can be done in a variety of different ways, where the standard has traditionally been signing a paper document. With the digital age the paper document standard has evolved into alternative formats such as the printed fax and the scanned PDF. These new document formats have been introduced to facilitate transactions and reduce transaction costs. But these advancements in signing solutions have not come without their pitfalls. Paper has several inherent qualities that are not easily transferrable into digital formats. Thus, in the haste of solving problems associated with high transaction costs; new technologies have been introduced at the cost of significant loss in evidence qualities of signed documents. </p>

<h2>Scrive´s solution</h2>
	<p>To understand how to remedy the problems with deteriorating evidence quality we have dug deep into understanding the characteristics of document evidence quality. With the knowledge we have gained we have aimed to create an appropriate document structure and evidence generation strategy that together produce the highest of quality evidence container.</p>
	<p>The target has been to reproduce the evidence qualities of the paper, the long-standing gold standard for evidence containers, while at the same time to add new qualities enabled by new available technology. Looking at the end-result we are proud to claim that we have produced what we believe to be an evidence container not only imitating the most important features of paper but also with qualities superior to paper. </p>

<h2>The evidence qualities of the paper</h2>
	<p>Before explaining our solution let us start by first understanding the evidence qualities of paper and relate the problems of trying to reproduce such qualities in digital formats.</p>

<h3>Durability</h3>

	<p>In order to prove that an agreement is legitimate it is important to be able to provide evidence and to prove that this evidence is credible. An original copy of the signed paper agreement is usually considered to be an acceptable piece of such credible evidence. The reason being, that paper is by nature an immutable format; once signed it is not editable and is virtually impossible to remove all data available (fingerprints and ink). Thus paper can be seen as a durable “snapshot” of reality, at the time that the agreement was made.</p>

	<p>On the other hand, digital formats such as the PDF copy of a signed and scanned paper document are by nature mutable formats. A person can easily modify or edit the document content in an editor program such as Adobe Photoshop. It’s quite simple to remove an important proof element like a time marker and replace it with a new one to suit a fabricated story about the document. </p>

	<p>Question to ask: how can we emulate the immutability of the paper format?</p>

<h3>Accessibility</h3>

	<p>Accessibility is a key component in the usefulness and quality of a document. The fewer tools or specialized expertise required for the interpretation of the document the more valuable it is as evidence as more people can easily understand it. Paper as a medium has two inherent characteristics that make it highly accessible:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><p>Paper signing is a format where all the contents are clearly displayed to everyone with reliable sight, thus paper doesn’t require any additional tools to interpret the contents.</p></li>
		<li><p>Paper is a standard medium familiar to most and as such it is easy to learn what to look for in order to identify the authenticity of the document, as that knowledge is readily available.</p></li>
	</ul>

	<p>Digital documents have the opposite characteristics:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>Digital documents can come in various forms and understanding how to  interpret them is highly dependent on the document format. In addition, with digital formats, information can be inserted into a document that is not necessarily visible to the naked eye and thus it is not by definition obvious where to look for the information.</p></li>
		<li><p>Digital documents by nature also require additional tools to be interpreted, like PDF-readers or other types of software. In an ideal case the format is standardized and the tools are easily accessible.</p></li>
		</ul>
	<p>As outlined above, accessibility is an inherent quality of the paper document but not necessarily that of a digital document. The availability of a digital document is highly dependent on the design of the software that produces it. </p>
	<p>Question to ask: what is required to make a digital document as accessible as a paper document?</p>

<h3>Capturing the identity</h3>

	<p>A common and familiar way of capturing an identity is with an identification card (driver’s license, passport etc). But paper has a less apparent ability by which it automatically collects evidence of identity of signing parties. When a signature is signed on paper, the visual representation can be used for signature comparisons while the ink can be analyzed to date the agreement. Additionally, during the paper signing process, the paper automatically captures fingerprints and other biometric materials from the signing parties which can be used to authenticate the signature. </p>
	<p>In the case of digitally signed documents there is no automatic collection of identity into the document. Data about the identity of the signing party is only captured and stored inside the document if the signing software is programmed to do so. Thus, the capturing of identity is highly dependent on the design of the software that produces the final document. </p>
	<p>Questions to ask: What identity data should be captured and how should it be embedded within the document in such a way that it could not be manually altered?</p>

<h3>Capturing the intent to sign</h3>

	<p>Contract law worldwide states that an agreement comes into effect when the agreeing parties understand that they are engaged in a signing process and have a voluntary intent to do so. Thus, intent is a key component for the legal establishment of an agreement. </p>
	<p>Paper has the characteristics that:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>The signing environment (the paper document) is the same as the final output (the signed paper document).</p></li>
		<li><p>Signing a paper is the most standardized form of making an agreement. It is reasonable to maintain that a mentally capable adult understands their actions when engaging in signing a paper document. Upon signing on paper, the implication of this action is assumed to be understood and it is nearly impossible to claim otherwise. Instances by which a claim could be made is if the party can prove mental incapacitation at the time of signing or claim that they were forced to sign, thus the action was not voluntary.</p></li>
	</ul>

	<p>On the other hand a digital environment has the opposite characteristics to paper:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><p>The signing environment is not the same as the final output. i.e. the displayed document is not the same as the final document produced by the system.</p></li>
		<li><p>Signing in a digital environment can happen in a variety of different of ways therefore the signing environment may not make it immediately clear that one is participating in signing a document. </p></li>
	</ul>
	<p>Together, the aforementioned characteristics create a situation where it is not beyond reason for a person to claim that they did not understand the activity they were engaged in and/or that it was not their intention to sign. The person could claim that the signing environment did not portray the same information as the final output (the displayed agreement was not the same as the document produced by the system) or that the signing environment did not make it clear that an action could produce a binding signature. Let’s make an extreme example:</p>
	<p><em>A person could claim that the system instead of showing “this is an agreement, click here to sign” was showing “this is a picture of a blue elephant, click here to see a pink sheep.” Therefore, upon clicking the button the person could not have been aware that they were participating in a signing process and thus could not have had the intention to sign.</em></p>
	<p>Question to ask: how can we generate unquestionable proof of the intention to sign in a digital signing environment?</p>

<h3>Third party independence</h3>

	<p>Things change and companies come and go. Signed documents stay the same. If the provability of a signed document is dependent on third parties the document provability risks changing over time. </p>
	<p>The signed paper is by definition independent of third parties for evidence because the evidence can physically only be present at one place at any given time. Either it is in the document or it is not. Digital data on the other hand can be in many places at the same time. Therefore, just because data about a transaction exists it is not given that the data has been printed into the document. If the data is printed into the document, this is the best case. In the worst case the data is not printed into the document and is erased. In a third scenario the data is not printed into the document but is stored in a database outside the document. This third scenario creates a dependency between the holder of the document and the holder of the database, where the holder of the document is dependent on the holder of the database for access to pieces of evidence. Depending on the amount and importance of the data withheld from the document, this may or may not become a future problem. When the holder of the document requires access to that data they could have trouble gaining access to the database to obtain the necessary data.</p>
	<p>Question to ask: how to make an electronic signed document independent of third parties?</p>

<h2>Potential for additional evidence qualities</h2>

<p>Paper has many important qualities as a high quality evidence container, but there are several enhancement opportunities with new technology.</p>

<h3>Metadata collection</h3>

	<p>Paper allows for a limited set of metadata to be appended to a document and this data must be appended manually in writing (time, place and other comments). But digitally signed documents allow for an infinite amount of metadata to be appended in many different formats (i.e. video, audio, text). This ability to append limitless amounts of data and with various formats creates possibilities to further reinforce the document evidence qualities by appending more data and data with special evidence qualities.</p>

<h3>Capturing time</h3>

	<p>In many processes, such as a bidding process, accurate time measurement is important to the transaction, as it can be the difference between an approved or  unapproved bid. Using the paper signing format, the time must be recorded manually which gives way to inaccuracies and disagreements. Digital documents on the other hand can record time with a much higher accuracy. Nevertheless, problems with time accuracy in digital signing formats persist. As a famous Swedish court case shows, recording time is not necessarily the same as a credible time record. Example:</p>
	<p><em>A company was engaged in a bidding process and sent their bid by fax one minute to 12, in the last minute before the deadline. But the time recorded by the receiving fax machine was one minute past 12, within one minute past the deadline. As this was a bid to a Swedish municipality, Swedish law prohibited acceptance of the bid. The bidding party, convinced that their fax time was correctly set, went to court disputing the case. The case went all the way to the supreme court where the supreme court ruled in favor of the receiving party as it could not be proven that the receiving party actually had the wrong time set on their fax machine. Additionally the telecom company who was responsible for the fax wire had not set their system in such a way that they could prove the time deviation of their system from standard time. Thus, it could not be credibly shown that the time record of the telecom company was accurate.</em></p>

<h2>The Scrive evidence container</h2>

	<p>We have now analyzed the important evidence quality characteristics of paper and the potential for additional evidence qualities previously not possible with the paper format. How does Scrive´s solution relate to these issues and how have they been interpreted?</p>

<h3>Time Drift Prevention system</h3>
	<p>As described earlier, capturing time in a credible manner can be very important. As it stands, there are a relatively low number of cases with which time capture is critical, but such things cannot be predicted. Therefore, to eliminate this unnecessary company risk, a quality solution should guarantee a time capture in 100% of all documents signed.</p>
	<p>At Scrive we keep our systems synchronized with local NTP (Network Time Protocol) systems that are synced to as high a stratum NTP server as possible. This produces an accuracy of time that is virtually impossible to refute. The minimum and maximum poll intervals for the NTP server are left at defaults (minpoll 6, maxpoll 10 on the default Linux NTP server – these settings are seconds to the power of 2). This is because updating too often can be prone to more errors and jitter, and updating after too long can produce bigger corrections due to the larger timespan between updates. With these settings we have had an average drift of 0.000789 seconds and a maximum drift of 0.022 seconds the year 2012.</p>
	<p>For provability purposes the latest synchronizations and reported time drift at each synchronization is recorded by the Scrive system and inserted into the Evidence Log (as described below).</p>

<h3>Generating the Evidence Container</h3>
	<p>Scrive provides a set of signing processes that enable the signing parties to come to an agreement. Once all signing parties have signed the agreement the Scrive system will execute the following actions to finalize the “Evidence Container”. The steps are as follows:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><p>Make the agreement into a PDF.</p></li>
		<li><p>Print additional information added during the signing process into the PDF (visual signature, text, checked checkboxes and more).</p></li>
		<li><p>Append a “Verification Page” as an extra page to the PDF.</p></li>
		<li><p>Append the “Evidence Documentation” (as described in this section) as an appendix to the PDF </p></li>
		<li><p>Append the “Evidence Log” as an appendix to the PDF.</p></li>
		<li><p>Append the “Evidence of Intent” as an appendix to the PDF.</p></li>
		<li><p>Append the “Digital Signature Documentation” as an appendix to the PDF.</p></li>
		<li><p>Sign the Evidence Package (PDF plus appendices) with a digital signature.</p></li>
	</ol>
		<p>A detailed description of the steps 3-8 follows below.</p>

<h3>Appending the Verification Page (step 3)</h3>
	<p>The Verification Page is intended to make the most important metadata of the transaction as accessible as possible. The key details include who signed which documents, when and how. The Verification Page contains the following information:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Transaction ID</p></li>
			<li><p>Selected document details</p></li>
			<li><p>Selected signing person details</p></li>
			<li><p>Selected non-signing person details</p></li>
			<li><p>Selected actions of each signing person, time of action and IP-number</p></li>
			<li><p>A seal confirming that a third party has verified the transaction</p></li>
		</ul>
	<p>At the end of the Verification Page there is brief documentation describing what the verification page is. The documentation is intended to give the reader all the information necessary in order to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Understand the nature of the document</p></li>
			<li><p>Understand where to find any additional documentation about the document</p></li>
			<li><p>Understand how to simply verify the integrity of the document</p></li>
		</ul>
	<p>This information is intended to be useful even if Scrive ceases to exist, making the document understandable and useful independently of Scrive.</p>

<h3>Appending the Evidence Documentation (step 4)</h3>
	<p>Full documentation about the Evidence Package is appended as an appendix to the signed PDF (hereinafter the “Evidence Documentation”). The Evidence Documentation is a complete instruction manual of how to interpret the different parts of the Evidence Package and is intended to make understanding and use of the Evidence Package as easy as possible and independently of any third party (including independence from Scrive), thus removing the need for any special resources or expertise for the interpretation of the document and making it fully accessible and useful for anyone.</p>

<h3>Appending the Evidence Log (Step 5)</h3>
	<p>The Scrive system will record as many of the signatories’ actions as possible as log data (“Transaction Log”) and once the Scrive system has produced the signed PDF, a document containing all data from the Transaction Log is appended as an appendix (“Evidence Log”). Note that the Verification Page only contains selected transaction log data with the intention to make a preselected set of transaction history easily accessible, while the Evidence Log itself contains all transaction log data with the intention to make all transaction history easily accessible. The extensive logging of the parties’ actions and the appending of the Evidence Log is carried out with the intention of optimally enhancing the document quality through the additional metadata of the transaction.</p>

<h3>Appending the Evidence of Intent (Step 6)</h3>
	<p>The Scrive system will make screenshots of each party’s signing experience as evidence of the intent to sign. When the Scrive system is preparing the Evidence Package it will append the Evidence of Intent which is a document with a brief description of the actions of the signing process, who did what and when, with the screenshots included. The intention behind appending the Evidence of Intent is to provide the parties with evidence of such signing intentions in order to provide additional evidence in the potential situation as exemplified with the blue elephant and the pink sheep example.</p>

<h3>Appending the Digital Signature Documentation (Step 7)</h3>
	<p>The Scrive system will also append the Digital Signature Documentation to the Evidence Package. The Digital Signature Documentation contains an algorithm for how to prove the document’s integrity mathematically. With the help of the Digital Signature Documentation the document integrity can be tested mathematically without the help of Scrive or any other third party. This document does require some technical knowledge to be useful.</p>
	<p>Note: the Digital Signature Documentation is not intended as the primary method for proving the document’s integrity. The use of the Digital Signature Documentation is intended as a last resort after which all other methods of verifying the integrity have failed. To clarify, the intended order for verifying the integrity of a document is:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><p>Scrive provides the primary method for verifying the integrity of a signature at www.scrive.com/verify. Here the document owner can upload the document and get an automated validation of the document integrity. This method does not require any technical knowledge to be useful.</p></li>
			<li><p>If this primary method , for some reason fails to perform the verification of integrity then the digital signature provider, Guardtime, can be contacted directly for verification. This second method also does not require any technical knowledge to be useful.</p></li>
			<li><p>Finally, if both previous methods have failed, the Digital Signature Documentation can be used to mathematically verify the document integrity.</p></li>

<h3>Appending the Digital Signature (Step 8)</h3>
	<p>Once all extra documentation has been appended to the document, the document wrapper is digitally signed with an industry standard digital signature from Guardtime.</p>


<h2>Summary 1: Legal effects of the Scrive solution</h2>

	<p>To summarize, all the above measures involved in producing the Scrive PDF effectively address the different problems of deteriorating digital document quality.</p>

	<ul>
		<li><p>Infinite durability (better than paper) is assured with the help of appending the digital signature (step 8) and with the help of the Digital Signature Documentation (step 7).</p></li>
		<li><p>Maximum accessibility is assured by appending the Verification Page to the PDF containing a short documentation (step 3) and appending the full Evidence Documentation document which fully explains all parts of the document and eliminates any need for further expertise or resources (step 4).</p></li>
		<li><p>Capturing identity is assured by meticulous data collection to the Transaction Logs and then printing selected identity data into both the Verification Page (step 3) and more detailed identity data into the Evidence Log (step 5).</p></li>
		<li><p>Capturing intent is assured by the screenshot mechanism and by appending the Evidence of Intent document to the PDF (step 6).</p></li>
		<li><p>Capturing time is assured by the Time Drift Prevention system, the logging of average, max and minimum time drift and the recording of such into the Evidence Log (step 5).</p></li>
		<li><p>Collecting additional data to further improve the document quality is carried out by the Time Drift Prevention system and by the redundant collection of logs into the Transaction Log and the final printing of all available data into the Evidence Log (step 5).</p></li>
	</ul>

<h2>Summary 2: Independence effects of the Scrive solution</h2>

	<p>The holder of the document is made independent of Scrive because:</p>

	<ol>
		<li><p>The holder of the document is not dependent on the Scrive logs to prove document durability due to the digital signature appended (step 8) and the Digital Signature Documentation (step 7).</p></li>
		<li><p>The holder of the document is not dependent on the Scrive logs for additional evidence in case of conflict, as all evidence available to Scrive was made available to the holder of the document through the Evidence Log (step 5).</p></li>
		<li><p>The holder of the document is not dependent on access to old versions of the Scrive system to prove the original signing environment to prove all parties’ intent to sign. Instead the evidence of intent is made available to the holder of the document through the Evidence of Intent document (step 6).</p></li>
		<li><p>Finally, the holder of the document is made independent of other parties and/or Scrive’s expertise to interpret the document, through the Evidence Documentation document that is appended (step 4).</p></li>
	</ol>

<h2>Appendix: Evidence quality analysis between newer document standards and paper</h2>

	<p>For the reader to be able to put the Scrive evidence container into perspective it could be useful to understand the evidence quality characteristics of documents signed through other types of signing solutions. To give an overview of the quality of available formats the following table describes the differences in critical legal qualities between paper and other newer document formats. A brief elaboration of the strength and weaknesses of each format can be found below the table. </p>

	<p>Note:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Paper has already been described in the previous section as the standard and will therefore not be described in further detail below.</p></li>
			<li><p>Notes about capturing time would be the same for all different cases; it depends on each service provider and as described above it’s known that even the largest can fail. We will therefore not describe this in any further detail below.</p></li>
		</ul>

<h3><em>Fax</em></h3>

	<p>The “fax” is a result of a document signed on paper and sent back to the counterpart by using a facsimile.</p>

	<ul>
		<li><p><em>Strengths</em>: The facsimile is paper. Therefore just like paper it captures intent and is highly durable and accessible just like a normal signed paper.</p></li>
		<li><p><em>Weaknesses</em>: What the fax lacks is biometric data from both signing parties (fingerprints and more). The fax merely transmits a photocopy of the signature as an identifier and could therefore when it comes to capturing identity could be considered substantially weaker than paper. Another weakness is metadata collection. Some metadata may be printed on the document when the fax is printed but the format does not allow for much more than the standard paper (time, place and some comments) therefore the data collection can be considered as weak as the data collection for paper.</p></li>
	</ul>

<h3><em>Scanned PDF</em></h3>

	<p>The “scanned PDF” is a result of printing the contract on paper, signing with a pen, scanning it and sending the document back using email or other electronic communication. More and more commonly the printing and signing step is also eliminated and the signing is executed by a copy and paste procedure (reusing a saved signature), by using some kind of software.</p>

	<ul>
		<li><p><em>Strengths</em>: The scanned PDF is originally signed on paper or by a similar digital method controlled by the signing party. Therefore intent to sign can be considered to be executed in the same way as on a paper. There is some automatic collection of metadata in the digital transaction (usually email), especially if the email contains the full thread of the previous interaction and therefore metadata collection can be considered fairly good. The signed and scanned PDF is a standard format so the accessibility can be considered high both because it is easy to interpret the contents and the technology required to do so is accessible.</p></li>
		<li><p><em>Weaknesses</em>: The primary weakness with the scanned PDF is that more often than not, no measures have been taken to ensure the documents durability and thus provability of integrity over time (such as applying a digital signature for example). Therefore the document is susceptible to forgery and is very weak as evidence of the transaction. In fact, the e-mail with which the document was sent could be argued to be stronger evidence of the transaction than the document itself, as log records of the email transaction can be used as supportive evidence. Unfortunately as the scanned PDF-document is highly mutable, the credibility of the visual signature also suffers, as it is easy to copy-paste a new signature into the document at a later point in time while erasing any traces of such editing. Therefore capturing the identity of the signed and scanned PDF is weaker than in the fax format. It could be considered to have next to no measure of ensuring that document durability has been applied (ex. a digital signature).</p></li>
	</ul>

<h3><em>Email OK</em></h3>

	<p>The “email OK” is a result of which one party emails a document or a text string containing an agreement and the other party replies with an “OK” or similar.</p>

	<ul>
		<li><p><em>Strengths</em>: The email OK is “signed” (okayed) with a software that can be considered to have been within each signing parties domain of control. Therefore the intent to sign can be assumed. In addition, the format of the “document” (email) is a standard format, the contents should be easy to interpret and the tools (email client) should be easy to obtain. Therefore accessibility can be considered high.</p></li>
		<li><p><em>Weaknesses</em>: Just like with the scanned PDF, more often than not, no measures are taken to ensure the document durability and provability of integrity over time (such as applying a digital signature). Therefore the email is, just like the scanned PDF, susceptible to forgery and evidence of integrity is dependent on the availability and quality of the logs of the email provider. Identity cannot usually be captured in another way other than capturing the email of the counterpart. In many B2B (business-to-business) transactions where the counterpart has a company specific email, this is sufficient as identification. In B2C (business-to-consumer) or C2C (consumer-to-consumer) transactions identification can easily be a problematic issue as private persons have email addresses from providers that don’t require any form of identification (such as Gmail, Yahoo! or Hotmail) and therefore in such cases, possibilities for identification can be considered very weak.</p></li>
	</ul>

<h3><em>E-signing PDF</em></h3>

	<p>The “e-signing PDF” is a result of the parties using a third party SaaS (software-as-a-service) provider as a platform for executing an agreement. Usually one party uses the software to invite the counterpart to sign inside the SaaS provider’s software and the final product of the procedure is an e-signed PDF produced and stamped by the SaaS provider. This type of software is used as a signing process management tool. Scrive is one of many solutions within this category of solutions. In this section we describe our overall perspective of known solutions, Scrive excluded (to be described in more detail further down):</p>

	<ul>
		<li><p><em>Strengths</em>: These types of services enable identification in many different ways such as email, IP-address, text messaging, photo, fingerprint scanning and more. All of this identity data can be captured and placed into the document. Most e-signing services provide multiple types of identification and could therefore be considered fairly strong in this area. Although of course, the quality of the identification is dependent on what the sending user selects as the method for identification. Most services also collect metadata about the transaction and print it into the document as a time trail describing the actions taken by the parties using IP and time. Thus, metadata collection can be considered fairly strong.</p></li>
		<li><p><em>Weaknesses</em>: One of the main differences between the method of generating an e-signed PDF and the other types of processes generating signed documents (described above) is that the receiving counterpart cannot be considered to have control over the signing environment. This is a significant problem because it can become difficult to prove that the invited party had an intention to sign. As described in a previous example, the receiving party could claim they did not understand that they were engaged in signing a document. They could claim that they were under the impression that they were “clicking a button to see an image change from a blue elephant to a pink”. There is a lack of documentation regarding this risk, and it is possible that many e-signing providers might not even be aware of this risk.  </p></li>
	</ul>

		<p>To continue, two more problems exist: </p>
		<p>First, if an e-signing provider does not take measures to ensure the document’s durability (ex. stamping the document with a digital signature), the evidence of the document integrity will lie in the logs at the e-signing service’s database. Thus, customers of the e-signing provider would in effect be giving up the ability to prove the originality of the documents without relying on the good faith of the provider and/or the continued existence of the provider as a business. This is a risky situation for any company to be in as they should have complete and indisputable ownership of their own legal documents. </p>
		<p>Second, the documents produced by the e-signing provider cannot by default be considered the standard (as the format is still new to the market and standards are still being developed). Given this unfamiliarity it is likely that, without access to clear documentation, both legal and technical expertise would be required to understand all aspects of the document. This is of course problematic as it can potentially skew the power to parties with deeper pockets or more expertise available and can also induce insecurities in a legal process. What if the court cannot fully interpret the document? What if the e-signing provider is no longer in existence to assist with an explanation?</p>
