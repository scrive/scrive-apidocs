  <p>This is the GuardTime PDF Toolkit, an addendum to the GuardTime Client SDK for Java.</p>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>The purpose of the toolkit is to enable integration of GuardTime signatures into PDF files.</p>
  <p>The integration format is based on the document time-stamp syntax defined in the PAdES specification (ETSI TS 102 778, Part 4, Section A.2) which in turn relies on the general digital signature mechanism of the PDF format (ISO 32000-1:2008, Section 12.8).</p>
  <p>Current implementation is based on the iText library for PDF format handling and the GuardTime Client API and Bouncy Castle Crypto API for handling GuardTime signatures.</p>
  <p>Some rather simple end-user tools are provided, mostly as usage examples for the toolkit, but they could also be deployed as-is.</p>
