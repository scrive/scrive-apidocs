msgstr "Scrive stores all legal data (read more under \"Legal\") at TrustWeaver and we offer our customers to also save their documents in their storage. The TrustWeaver service, TrustWeaver On Demand, is installed in two data centers, geographically seperated from eachother at a distans larger than 30 km. The atom bomb proof server halls where the TrustWeaver On Demand servers are kept maintains the highest security standards available. They are located in caverns previosly used by the Swedish military, and the main data center is classified as secured object according to the Swedish law (1990:217) concerning the protection of critical functions in society. The facilities are guarded by access card controlls, closed circut servailance camera systems, alarm with motion detectors, fire protection systems, UPS power system with disel back-up generators, and locked and sealed server rackets wich can only be opened with copy protected keys. All ICC-cards are sealed in a ICC-card racket by specially desigend adhesive security tape."

msgstr "The system behind Scrive is based on Haskell. Haskell is a robust technology that was developed by some of the best mathematical programmers in the world. Two key properties of the technology is the high system stability and reliability that comes with it. This results in lower probability of the occurance of security holes than that of traditionally used systems. The stability and reliability of Haskell is the main reason why it is used in some of the most security consious organisations in the world. The usage of Haskell in US government web based platforms handeling secret information is just one example of this."
