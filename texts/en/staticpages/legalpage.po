Strong type checking means that no code may be implemented into the system without first being accepted as logically compatiblewith the rest of the system through strict automatic tests. Because of this, some problems just can not occur when programming in Haskell, and the probability of some other types of problems arising are much smaller than when using other technologies."

The answer is unfortunently that this cannot be bprevented by Scrive, since this is outside of Scrive's domain of control. Before drawing any conclusions from this one should as oneself: what is really the difference between today's hand-written signatures  and the electronical signatures provided by Scirve? How well does a hand-written signature answer to the very same questioning? As far as we know, no stolen passwords or technical knowlage is required to forge a hand-written signature, only a paper and a pen is needed, and how secure is that? Our conclusion is that electronical signatures by default is one step more secure than  hand-written ones, since the technology itself forms a barrier to intruders and allows Scrive to wittness the transaction by storing e.g. IP-adresses and implement advanced surveillance systems for preventing frauds. Scrive uses IP-registration and is considering implementing the advanced surveillance systems mentioned above."

E-ID is based on PKI technology, and therefore belongs to the category qualified signatures. E-ID is threby, by law, equivalent to hand-written signatures. Truth is, though, that an e-ID signature is way more complex and way harder to forge than a hand-written signature, and should therefore provide an even stronger evidence of agreement than a hand-written one. Only to add even further to the strenght of the evidence, the document is also signed by e-mail verification.

Since the identification of the user is nonexistent when creating such an account, other evidence is required to connect a signed document to a person, such as an e-mail conversation a phone conversation or something else. Today, Scrive does not have any methods for collecting such information, thus, this lies outside of Scrive's domain of control. Therefore we recommend our user not to use e-mail accounts provided by open distributors when signing a document. The vast majority of private e-mail users use this kind of open e-mail providers, therefore we discourage comapnies and private persons from using the e-mail verification in the service if not all parties have accesses to domain specific e-mail addresses such as work e-mail, school e-mail or alike."

In the second step, when the document has been signed by all parties, a confirmation is sent to all parties by e-mail. Omission to react if a user for some reason incorrectly recives a confirmation can be used as evidence argumenting for that the confirmation was, in fact, correct. We also collect the IP-addresses that the parties uses when they sign. IP-addresses are generated dynamically, and indicate, among other things, where the user is located.

The big difference between different kinds of agreements is not in the legal part, but rather the possibility to prove if an agreement exists at all, the content of it and who is involved in it. The reason to this is that different kinds of agreements generates different quality and quantity of evidence.

If one party claims that it does not have access to any proof material, problems will occur for the other party to show that the proof material put forward is genuine, and has not been created retrospectively. This situation could easily lead to a broken business relationship, and in worst case to a trial in court. When such a conflict is brought to court, the burden of proof usually falls on the party claiming that the contract has been signed by other parties.
