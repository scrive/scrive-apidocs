# How to do TX synchronisation:
#
# First make sure that you are on good branch - the one that is synched with TX. Right now it's staging.
# !!If you will be on different branch - you can destroy texts.
#
# First do:
#
#  ./transifex.sh diff-lang user password en
#
# And check if response looks reasonable. If there are 500 texts changed, it's bad, but 50 are ok.
# Now push your local source texts to transifex. This will make all english texts available to translators.
#
# ./transifex.sh push-lang user password en
#
# You should never to this with any other language, since it will overwrite translations. And translations should be done in TX, not in sources.
#
# Now it's time to fetch stuff from TX. You do that with
# ./transifex.sh merge-all user password
#
# This will fetch all source files for all languages. It will include english, and it is possible that TX will drop some spaces, etc.
# It still should be fine. For every change it will overwrite local file.
#
# After you merged it is always good to run tests with -t Localization. Errors should be fixed in TX, and then you just do synchronization again.
# But at this point you will not need to push english texts.
