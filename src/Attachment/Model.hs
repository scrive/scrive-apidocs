-- GetAttachments domains filters sorting pagination
--
-- * domains are connected with OR, so attachments falling into ANY of domains will be returned
-- * filters weed out attachments from domains, are connected with AND so a attachments must pass through ALL filters
-- * sortings returns attachments in order
-- * pagination is a place to put OFFSET and LIMIT values
--
-- GetAttachments returns attachments in proper order, no reverse is needed.
