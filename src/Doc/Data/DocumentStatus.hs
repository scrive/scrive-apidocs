   Document start in Preparation state.

   Meaning:
   * Preparation: Only author can see it. He's still editing.
   * Pending: People can sign document. Could be timed out.
   * AwaitingAuthor: Everyone has signed but the author.
   * Closed: Everybody signed. This is final state.
   * Canceled: Author has canceled the document.
   * Timedout: This works as autocancel and has exactly same
     properties.

   Transitions:
   * Preparation to Pending: When invitations are sent.
   * Preparation to Cancel: mail about cancel to
     all who have signed it already is sent.
     TODO: Should other parties get an email?
   * Preparation to Timedout: mail about timeout to
     all who have signed it already is sent.
   * Pending to Closed: When everyone has signed.
     Info about closed deal is sent to everybody involved.
   * Pending to AwaitingAuthor: When all signatories have signed and there were fields.
     Info is sent to author.
   * AwaitingAuthor to Closed: Author signs it.
   * Pending to Cancel: Send no emails.
   * Pending to Timeout: TODO: No action?

   Allowed actions:
   * Preparation: change document, change title, add/rem signatories
   * Pending: change email of a signatory, signatory can sign
   * AwaitingAuthor: autho can sign.
   * Closed: nothing
   * Canceled: edit back to Preparation
   * Timedout: edit back to Preparation

   Archived bit:
   * This bit just moves document out of main view.
