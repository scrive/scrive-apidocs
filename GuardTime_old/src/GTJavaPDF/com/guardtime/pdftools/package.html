  <p>This package contains some end-user tools.</p>
  <p>The tools could be used as-is or viewed as example code illustrating the use of the API in the <code>com.guardtime.pdf</code> package. Admittedly the JavaDoc does not make much sense for either purpose. For the former, you should go to the pre-compiled binary packages. For the latter, get the source package instead.</p>
